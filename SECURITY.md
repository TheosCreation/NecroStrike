## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you suspect a security vulnerability, please submit a Security Vulnerability issue in the Issues tab.

If you discover a non-security bug, please submit a Bug Report issue in the Issues tab.

When reporting a security vulnerability, include as much detail as possible without exposing sensitive data or full exploit code. This helps us address the issue quickly and safely.
